this repo is used to learn GraphQL with Asp.net Core under .NET 8.

## How to use GraphQL in ASP.NET Core?
We need to install third-party libraries or packages to use GraphQL in ASP.NET Core. here are several options available but two of the most popular libraries are [GraphQL .NET](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/) and [Hot Chocolate](https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate). Both libraries are very powerful and support a vast array of features but in the recent past, Hot Chocolate is gaining a lot of momentum due to its performance and advanced features.
### ðŸ‘‡Hot ChocolateðŸ‘‡
Hot Chocolate is an open-source GraphQL library that is compliant with the latest GraphQL specs. It takes away a lot of the complexity of building a full-fledge GraphQL server and lets you focus on writing your APIs. It is also very simple to set up and configure and removes the clutter from creating GraphQL schemas. Hot Chocolate comes with integration to the ASP.NET Core endpoints API and the middleware implementation follows the current GraphQL specification over HTTP. Another amazing feature of Hot Chocolate is that it has a built-in tool called Banana Cake Pop that makes it very easy and enjoyable to test our GraphQL server implementation.
